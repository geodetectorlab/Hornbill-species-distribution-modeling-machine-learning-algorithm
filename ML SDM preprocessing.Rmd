## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
pa = read.csv("pres_abs.csv")
pa = na.omit(pa)
head(pa)
summary(pa)

```


```{r cars}
library(caret)
set.seed(1) #pseudo-repeatbilty
trainIndex = createDataPartition(pa$pb, p = .75,
                                 list = F,
                                 times = 1) # y as basis of splitting
training = pa[trainIndex] # 75% data for model training
testing = pa[-trainIndex] # 25% for model testing

head(training)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
