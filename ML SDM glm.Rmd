## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(caret)
pa = read.csv("pres_abs.csv")
pa = na.omit(pa)
summary(pa)
pa
write.csv(pa, "pres_abs.csv")
```

```{r cars}

```

``` {.{.{.{.{.{.{.{.{set.seed(1)}}}}}}}}}
trainIndex = createDataPartition(pa$pb, p = 0.75,
                                 list = F,
                                 times = 1) # y as basisi of splitting
training = pa[ trainIndex, ] # 75% of the data
testing = pa[-trainIndex, ] # 25% of the data

set.seed(825)

dim(training)
dim(testing)
```

```{r cars}
attach(training)
pb = as.factor(training$pb) # 1stands for presence and 0 for absence
m1 = glm(pb ~., data = training) #base package
class(m1)
summary(m1)

```

```{r cars}
## caret
# define training control --> 10fold cv
train_control = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)
 

mod_fit=train(pb~.,data=training,trControl=train_control,method="glm",family="binomial")
summary(mod_fit)
 
```

```{r cars}
## importance of the different predictors
varImp(mod_fit) #caret
```

```{r cars}
## test the model 
p1 = predict(mod_fit, newdata = testing) # predict on the test data

# predicted presence and absence
p2 = predict(mod_fit, newdata = testing, type = "raw")
```

```{r}
#test model fit-auc
library(pROC)
roc.glmModel = pROC::roc(testing[,"pb"], p1) # compare testing data with predicted responses
```

```{r}
auc = pROC::auc(roc.glmModel)
auc
plot(roc.glmModel)
text(0.5, 0.5, paste("AUC = ", format(auc, digits = 5, 
                                      scientific = F)))
```

```{r}
## build an SDM
## read in all predictors since they are all significant
require(raster)
datafiles = Sys.glob("*.tif")
stck = stack()
for (i in 1:NROW(datafiles))  {
  tempraster = raster(datafiles[i])
  stck = stack(stck, tempraster)
}
```

```{r}
names(stck)
```

```{r}
#stck
#mod_fit
p1 = predict(stck, mod_fit) #use predict to implement the GLM model stored
#in mod_fit on the raster stack of our predictors
plot(p1,main="GLM Predictive Map")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
