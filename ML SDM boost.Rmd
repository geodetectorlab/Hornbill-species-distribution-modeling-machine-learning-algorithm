## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
mod.fit2 = train(pb~.,data = training,
                 trControl = train_control,
                 method = "gbm")
summary(mod.fit2)


```
```{r}
varImp(mod.fit2)
```
```{r}
p1 = predict(mod.fit2, newdata = testing)
library(pROC)
roc = pROC::roc(testing[,"pb"], p1)
auc = pROC::auc(roc)
auc
plot(roc)
text(0.5,0.5,paste("AUC = ", format(auc,
                                    digits = 3,
                                    scientific = F)))
```
```{r}
p4 = predict(stck, mod.fit2)
plot(p4, main = "GBM Predictive Map")
```
```{r}
library(gbm)
require(gbm)

boost = gbm(pb~., data = training,
            distribution = "gaussian",
            n.trees = 5000,
            interaction.depth = 4)
summary(boost)

plot(boost, i = "slope")
plot(boost, i = "altitude")
plot(boost, i = "preciptn")
plot(boost, i = "roughness1")
plot(boost, i = "tempMin")
plot(boost, i = "tempAvg")
```
```{r}
library(ModelMetrics)
attach(testing)
auc(testing$pb, p1)
confusionMatrix(testing$pb, p1, cutoff = 0.5)
overall = (31+212)/(31+0+2+212)
overall

logLoss(testing$pb, p1, distribution = "binomial")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
