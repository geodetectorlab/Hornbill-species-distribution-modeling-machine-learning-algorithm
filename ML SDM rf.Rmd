## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
pa = read.csv("Pres_abs.csv")
head(pa)
summary(pa)
attach(pa)

pb = as.factor(pb)
head(pa)
```
```{r}
library(caret)
# Split data into training and testing set
set.seed(1)
trainIndex = createDataPartition(pb, p = 0.75,
                                 list = F,
                                 times = 1)
training = pa[trainIndex, ]
testing = pa[-trainIndex, ]

# head(testing)
set.seed(825)

#train the model with predictors for prediction
train_control = trainControl(method = "cv", 
                             number = 10)
mod.fit = train(pb~., data = training,
                trControl = train_control,
                method = "rf", importance = T)
summary(mod.fit)

```


```{r}
# Check for predictors importance to our prediction
varImp(mod.fit)
```
```{r}
# Predict on the test data
p1 = predict(mod.fit, newdata = testing)

# Test model fit-auc
library(pROC)
# Compare the testing data with predicted responses
roc = pROC::roc(testing[,"pb"], p1) 

auc = pROC::auc(roc)
auc
plot(roc)
text(0.5, 0.5, paste("AUC =", format(auc,
                                     digits = 3,
                                     scientific = F)))
```
```{r}
# build the SDM
## Load the require raster data
require(raster)
datafiles = Sys.glob("*.tif")
stck = stack()
for (i in 1:NROW(datafiles)) {
  tempraster = raster(datafiles[i])
  stck = stack(stck, tempraster)
  
}

## Use predict to implement the model in mod.fit on the raster stack of our predictors
p = predict(stck, mod.fit)
plot(p, main = "RF Predictive Map")
```
```{r}
# Test the impact of individual predictors
require(randomForest) #randomforest package
# Build model with training set| predict with it
m1 = randomForest(pb~., data = training)
#class(m1)

# Predictors Partial Dependence in predicting habitat suitability for the species
partialPlot(m1, training, preciptn, pb)
#rf model, training set, raster[X], Y/response variable

# Use predict to implement the RF model stack in mod.fit on the raster stack of our predictors
p2 = predict(stck, m1)
plot(p2, main = "RF Predictive Map")


# Build model with all data set| predict with it
m2 = randomForest(pb~., data = pa)
p3 = predict(stck, m2)
plot(p3, main = "RF Predictive Map-All")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
