## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
pa = read.csv("pres_abs.csv")
pa = na.omit(pa)
head(pa)
attach(pa)

```

```{r}
library(caret)
set.seed(1)
trainIndex = createDataPartition(pb, p = .75,
                                 list = F, times = 1)
training = pa[trainIndex, ] #75% of the data for model training

testing = pa[-trainIndex, ] #25% of the data for testing set

head(training)
dim(training)
length(training)
```

```{r}
## caret 
# define training control --> 10 foldcv
train_control = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

#fit the model
mod_fit1=train(pb~altitude+aspect1+preciptn+roughness1+slope+tempAvg+tempMin,
               data=training,trControl=train_control,method="svmRadial")

summary(mod_fit1)
```

```{r}
# importance of the different predictors
varImp(mod_fit1)
```

```{r}
# test the model 
p1 = predict(mod_fit1, newdata = testing)

# test the model fit-auc
library(pROC)
roc.svmModel = pROC::roc(testing[,"pb"],p1) # compare testing data with predicted responses

auc = pROC::auc(roc)
auc



plot(roc.svmModel)
text(0.5, 0.5, paste("AUC =", format(auc, digits = 3,
                                     scientific = F)))
```

```{r}
# read in all predictors
datafiles = Sys.glob("*.tif") # or whatever identifes your files

stck = stack() # empty raster stack for storing raster layers

for (i in 1:NROW(datafiles)) {
  tempraster = raster(datafiles[i])
  stck = stack(stck, tempraster)
}
stck
plot(stck, 7)
```

```{r}
p1 = predict(stck, mod_fit1) # use predict to implement the SVM model stored in mod_fit on the raster stack of our predictors

plot(p1, main = " SVM [rbf kernel] Predictive Map")
```
```{r}
s = dropLayer(stck, 3)
s
mod_fit2 = train(pb~altitude+aspect1+roughness1+slope+tempAvg+tempMin, data = training, 
                 trcontrol = train_control,
                 method = "svmPoly")
summary(mod_fit2)
```
```{r}
p2 = predict(s, mod_fit2)
plot(p2, main = "svm [polynomial kernel] Predictive Map")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
