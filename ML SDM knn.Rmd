## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
mod_fit3 = train(pb~., data = training, method = "knn")
summary(mod_fit3)
```
```{r}
varImp(mod_fit3)
```
```{r}
p4 = predict(mod_fit3, newdata = testing)
library(pROC)
roc.knnModel = pROC::roc(testing[, "pb"], p4)
auc = pROC::auc(roc.knnModel)
auc

plot(roc.knnModel)
text(0.5, 0.5, paste("AUC = ", format(auc,digits = 2,
                                      scientific = F)))

```
```{r}
p4 = predict(stck, mod_fit3)
plot(p5, main = "kNN Predictive Map")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
